    <h1>Course Description</h1>
    <p>
        Python is one of the most popular programming langauges of the 21st century. It used for developing desktop applications, websites, and web applications. It is also
        <b>the</b> language to learn for becoming a data scientist.
        Functional programming (FP) is a way of thinking about software construction that
        emphasizes functional purity and immutability.
        Due to the ease of testing, verification and debugging of functional
        code, the use of functional programming is continuously on the rise in the industry.
        According to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies" target="_blank">Stack
        OverFlow Developer Survey 2019</a>, two of highest paying programming languages
        enforce the functional approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this course is to teach programming in Python (3.8) and the functional
        programming (FP) design methodology, with a focus on hands-on learning and industry
        relevance.
